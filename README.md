Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis is a fatal, irreversible, and progressive lung disease. In this disease, the healthy lung tissues are replaced with fibrotic tissues making it difficult for oxygen to pass from the lungs to the bloodstream. The patient experiences shortness of breath. With time this disease becomes severe and it ultimately leads 
to the death of the infected person. 
Force Vital Capacity and Honeycombing are the most significant indicators of Pulmonary Fibrosis. OSIC Kaggle dataset which provide 
with real medical data i.e., patient CT scans, initial force vital capacity values, and clinical metadata for this disease. 
The goal is to predict the progression of disease by predicting the next forced vital capacity values. Modified Laplace Log Likelihood is used as an evaluation metric.
A novel approach that is a combination of EfficientNetV2S and GRU is applied to this problem. The proposed approach yields better results. EfficientNetV2 is applied to images for feature extraction and GRU to tabular data to extract features from time series data.
Deep Learning solutions provide good results making it a good fit for the accurate prediction of progressive lung disease.
